Full Adder in Digital Logic

## Overview

I started designing this digital full adder shortly after learning about logic gates. In the beginning I started by drawing a full adder using XOR-gates and and-gates. The next step was to replace all gates with NAND-gates, so I drew a full adder using 9 NAND-gates. After drawing the whole logic with NAND-gates, I designed the circuit using the circuit simulator of HTL Braunau. I have included KiCad files, files for the circuit simulator (link in requirements) and other pictures.

## With bipolar transistors:

I built the first version of the full adder using bipolar transistors.
