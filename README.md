Full Adder in Digital Logic

## Overwiew

I started designing this digital full adder shortly after learning about logic gates. In the beginning I started by drawing a full adder using xor-gates and and-gates. The next step was to replace the xor-gates with nand-gates, so I drew a full adder using 9 nand-gates. After making the whole logic with nand-gates. I have included KiCad files, files for a circuit simulator (link in requirements) and other pictures.

## With transistors:

I built the first version of the full adder using NPN transistors. A picture is shown below:
